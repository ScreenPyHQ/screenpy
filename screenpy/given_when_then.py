"""Given, When, and Then are Gherkin-style directives.

The general idea is:
* given/given_that is for test setup or "arrange" steps.
* when is for test actions or the "act" steps.
* then is for test assertions or the "assert" steps.
* and_ can be used for continuations of any of the above.

All of these are identity functions, only used to provide a little extra
context to your tests. An example test flow might be:

    given(Perry).was_able_to(
        Start.on_the_homepage(),
        LogIn.using(USERNAME, PASSWORD),
    )

    when(Perry).attempts_to(Click.on_the(LOGOUT_BUTTON))

    then(Perry).should(
        See.the(Text.of_the(BANNER_MESSAGE), ReadsExactly("Goodbye!"))
    )

[The Gherkin reference](https://docs.cucumber.io/gherkin/reference/) can
explain more.
