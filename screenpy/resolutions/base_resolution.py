Resolutions provide the expected answers to Questions. All Resolutions
are given the expected value when instantiated. For example:

    ReadsExactly("the expected text")

The Resolution will then be passed in to an Actor's test method, along
with a Question to get the actual value. An assertion might look like:

    Perry.should(
        See.the(Text.of(THE_WELCOME_MESSAGE), ReadsExactly("Welcome!")),
    )
