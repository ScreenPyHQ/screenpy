# This pyproject.toml is setup so it can be used with or without poetry and also
# supports editable installs (PEP 660) without breaking IDE and linter inspection.

# DEVELOPER INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS (assuming current directory is at the top of the project) :
# Poetry:
#   poetry install --extras dev
# PIP:
#   pip install -e .[dev]

# It's possible to add optional dependencies with the poetry CLI tool using:
#   poetry add --optional some_dev_pkg
# This will set `optional = true` flag in [tool.poetry.dependencies], as seen below
# But then you need to remember to manually edit the [tool.poetry.extras] dev section 
# and declare the package. This allows `pip install .[dev]` to work as expected
# Poetry users will need to use the `--extras dev` option rather than the `--with dev`
# so we dont have two different sets of package versions to update.
