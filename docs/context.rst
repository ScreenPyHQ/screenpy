Additional Context
==================

Screenplay Pattern uses composition instead of inheritance to form the test suite. The concept was first formed by Antony Marcano—frustrated with Page Object Model files growing unreasonably large—under the name the Journey Pattern.

You can watch `Antony's talk about Screenplay Pattern at SeleniumConf2016 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f8tdZBvAbI>`_, which is the same talk that got me interested in this pattern!

You can also see some documentation about screenplay pattern from the folks who made `SerenityBDD <http://serenity-bdd.info/#/documentation>`_, the library that ScreenPy is modeled after: `The Screenplay Pattern - Serenity/JS Handbook <https://serenity-js.org/design/screenplay-pattern.html>`_
