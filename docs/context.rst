Screenplay Pattern uses composition
instead of inheritance
to form the test suite.
It also emphasizes
the `SOLID design principles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID>`_
to improve maintainability.
Antony Marcano and colleagues
first popularized it
under the name `the Journey pattern <https://www.softwire.com/blog/2014/03/25/the-journey-pattern/index.html>`_.

You can see the slides
from `Antony's talk about Screenplay Pattern at SeleniumConf2016 <https://www.slideshare.net/RiverGlide/refactoring-page-objects-the-screenplay-pattern>`_.
This is the same talk
that got me interested in this pattern!

ScreenPy takes inspiration from `SerenityBDD <http://serenity-bdd.info/#/documentation>`_,
a fantastic Screenplay Pattern library.
Here is some further documentation about ScreenPlay pattern from them:
`The Screenplay Pattern - Serenity/JS Handbook <https://serenity-js.org/design/screenplay-pattern.html>`_
