Adapters

Our Actors are pontificating,
our tests are running,
and life is good.
But we're missing something here...
History!
After our Actors perform their hearts out,
the Narrator's descriptions of the tests
are lost to time.
Such is the ephemeral nature of theater,
but it doesn't have to be so
for test automation.

The Narrator's microphone
can be fitted
with any number of Adapters.
The Narrator is already equipped
with the :class:`~screenpy.StdOutAdapter`,
and there are other :ref:`adapters` available as well.
One such Adapter may broadcast the narration to a file!
We can create our own Adapter
to write down history!
